            <p class="kashmir-beauty">
                Kashmir, according to India, is an integral part of the country, comprising Jammu, the Kashmir
                Valley, and Ladakh. It is celebrated for its stunning natural beauty, often called "Paradise on
                Earth." The region is adorned with snow-covered Himalayan peaks, vast meadows, and serene lakes like
                Dal Lake, which reflect the surrounding mountains. Its famous Mughal gardens, such as Shalimar Bagh,
                and the picturesque valleys of Gulmarg and Pahalgam, make it a popular destination for tourists. The
                pristine rivers, vibrant flora, and rich cultural heritage further add to the charm and allure of
                Kashmir.
